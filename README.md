# Definition
An empty program is defined as a program that runs an implementation of the empty algorithm. The empty algorithm does literally nothing.

# Computational Complexity
Any identical and/or equal (see license) program has a time complexity of O(0), and only identical programs have space complexity of O(0). Any other equivalent program has O(1)

# Validity
This program is a polyglot in **a lot** of langs. But it's also a *true polyglot* in the sense that it does exactly the same thing in many langs... it does nothing.
