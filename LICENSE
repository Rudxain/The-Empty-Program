The "Null" License.
This software is the property of everyone and nobody, simultaneously. Therefore, there are no copyright holders.
There is no copyright date, because this software is timeless, eternal, and ephemeral.
This software isn't invented, nor discovered.
This software has no warranty, because it does nothing, and it's nothing.
No entity is responsible for any positive or negative events that happen to any other entity while using this software, because this program has no use.

One of the conditions is (but is not limited to) that this license should only be used by instances of empty programs. A program is considered an "instance" of the empty program if and only if it does nothing. This means a program entirely composed of "No-Ops" (no operations) is equivalent to an empty program, and therefore can (but it's not obligated to) be licensed under these terms.
Any and all programs that are not equivalent to the empty program shall not be licensed under these terms.
